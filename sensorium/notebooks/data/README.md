# /data directory

To use our example notebooks, simply download all individual datasets from [https://gin.g-node.org/cajal/Sensorium2022](https://gin.g-node.org/cajal/Sensorium2022) into this folder. 

**Note:** Downloading the files all at once as a directory does lead to unfortunate errors. Thus, all datastes have to be downloadede individually.

The content of this directory then should be the individual dataste files, such as
`['static22846-10-16-GrayImageNet-94c6ff995dac583098847cfecd43e7b6.zip', ...]`
