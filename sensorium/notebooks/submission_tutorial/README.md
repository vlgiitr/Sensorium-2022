# How to make a Submission

We have created a website for our benchmark, where the performance of all predictive models are shown.

The notebooks in this folder illustrate the submission process and provide a step by step guide.

The submissions must have the form of `.csv` files, that contain the predicted responses of the neurons to the held out test images (both the `final_test` and `live_test` sets).

<br>[**Notebook 1**](./1_sensorium_submission.ipynb): shows a step-by-step guide on how to create a submission file with one of our provided pretrained baselines.
<br>[**Notebook 2**](./2_behind_the_scenes.ipynb): Goes in detail in explaining how the evaluation is actually performed on the backend of the website.
