# Neural Predictive Model Tutorial

Here, we provide a brief overview of our neural predictive model.

For our competition, we have trained two baselines:
- Our state-of-the-art CNN model
- a simple linear-nonlinear (LN) model

Have a look our demo notebook as an introduction as to how our [**CNN model**](./0_baseline_cnn.ipynb) works.

We also show how to train a model on multiple datasets at once, compute its performance, and show the retinotopy of the V1 neurons by relating the learned RF position to the anatomical coordinates with V1:
[**Generalization demo**](./2_model_evaluation_and_inspection.ipynb).

#### CPU vs GPU

We recommend to use a machine with a CUDA compatible GPU. On a CPU, the model training and evaluation is possible, too, but quite slow. To use CPU only, set `device=cpu` instead of `device=cuda` in the example notebooks.

# Video Explanation

- [**This Video**](https://youtu.be/xwLMO8nVvxs?t=220) goes into the details of how our model is built (prepared for ICLR 2021).
