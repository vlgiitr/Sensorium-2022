## 1. Overview

The **NeurIPS 2022 The SENSORIUM competition** aimed to find the best neural predictive model that can predict the activity of thousands of neurons in the primary visual cortex of mice in response to natural images. <br/>
### Tracks:
**SENSORIUM** - Stimulus-only - Assessed on how well they predict neural activity solely in response to the visual stimulus averaged over all trials.<br/>
**SENSORIUM+** - Stimulus-and-Behavior - Assessed based on how well they can predict neural activity given additional behavioral variables. <br/> <br/>
This repository contains our submission for this competition, where we attempted to improve the baseline model for the competition track- **Sensorium+**.

## 2. Setup Instructions

Below is a step-by-step guide for getting started.

### 1. Pre-requisites
- install [**docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [**docker-compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- install git
- clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/sinzlab/sensorium.git`

### 2. Download neural datasets

You can download the data from [https://gin.g-node.org/cajal/Sensorium2022](https://gin.g-node.org/cajal/Sensorium2022) and place it in `sensorium/notebooks/data`. <br/>
**Note:** Downloading all the files at once as a directory leads to subsequent errors. Hence, download all datasets individually.

### 3. Run the example notebooks

#### **Start Jupyter environment**
```
cd sensorium/
docker-compose run -d -p 10101:8888 jupyterlab
```
Now, type `localhost:10101` in your browser address bar, and you are good to go!

## 3. Changes implemented:
- While finding the mean and variance of the neuron specific receptive field, we experimented with introducing multiple samplings of the same to increase number of parameters. </br>
- Also experimented with tuning the hyper-parameters such as making changes in the batch sizes of the datasets during training of the model, as well as layers, hidden channels, learning rate.

## 4. Evaluation

- We use the predictions stored in the .csv submission file, generated using the API provided by Sensorium to evaluate the performance of our method. 
- We were able to replicate the Single Trial Correlation and The Correlation Average score of the State-Of-The-Art Model provided.
    

### Tutorial Notebooks
[**Dataset tutorial**](notebooks/dataset_tutorial/):  Visual rendering and analysis of the structure of datasets through graphs and tables, and the code to turn it into a PyTorch DataLoader.
<br>[**Model tutorial**](notebooks/model_tutorial/): How to train and evaluate baseline models.
<br>[**Submission tutorial**](notebooks/submission_tutorial/): Use the Sensorium API to generate a .csv file and make a submission to the competition.
